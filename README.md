# Basic game Framework

## The backend Services

### Score service

The Score service proposed here is a simplified servce to show centralized user hight scores and display in the HighScore state of the demo.

You may certainly better use some Steam or Google Play player services. But here is a simple example of how to interact from a Desktop app with a "in the cloud" service.

Enjoy !
